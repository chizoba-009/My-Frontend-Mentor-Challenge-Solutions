## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to center a div (vertically and horizontally) using flex-box and how it is important to us

```css
main {
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

for it to work. I had fun making this project and I am looking forward to making more projects and improving my skills.

### Continued development

For future projects i'll like to learn more on grid and tailwindcss.
